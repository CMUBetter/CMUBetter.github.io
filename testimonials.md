# Testimonials

These anonymous testimonials were shared with us by the CMU graduate community when we conducted our first campaign raising awareness of pay disparities across departments in early 2022. (note: these may be edited for brevity or clarity.)

Since then, the university has instituted a pay floor, but it does not cover all graduate students and does not adequately cover costs of living in Pittsburgh. 

* Given current inflation, I wouldn't be able to pay my bills if I wasn't splitting costs with my partner. We need two incomes and we don't even have children.

* Thank god food stamps and Medicare are around to pick up CMU's slack in not paying a living wage or providing benefits to its grad student employees. The wellbeing of CMU's thousands of grad student employees is obviously worth far less to the bloated administration than growing their endowment.

* Most companies (and even grad schools now) adjust salaries with inflation. Seems odd CMU doesn’t do the same. Generally with higher wages I would live in an apartment whose [structural] health doesn’t concern me on a daily basis.

* I am an international student and can't work a legal half-time job. I had to sell my plasma thrice during the past 2 weeks to make rent. I dont eat out, I dont have a car, I haven't had a vacation in the last 10 years. If you don't have old family money in grad school you are fucked. I will be kicked back to my country when grad school ends and its hard to find a job there, and even though we get poverty wages this may be the best financial time in my life I guess? Also grad school is classist as fuck, and I guess the unequal wages are to blame.

* A lighthearted anecdote: sometimes I'll go on dates with people I have no romantic interest in as a way to save money on food. A less lighthearted anecdote: I've taken up smoking as an appetite suppressant.
…While I don’t want to in any way diminish the impact of the low wages/stipends students in other CMU schools face, I will reiterate: in [the School of Design], WE GET NOTHING AT ALL. We get less than nothing, because we don’t even get our full tuition covered, let alone living expenses. For a university like CMU, that has access to vast financial resources, prides itself on interdisciplinary education, and whose SoD is one of the top ranked in the world, it is unacceptable that they cannot provide a modicum of substantial financial support. Not only are the students who do come here burdened with enormous debt, but the financial barrier permanently locks out an even bigger number of potential applicants. If SoD wants to get serious about their newfound, supposed commitments to DEI, accessibility, and student health, they need to put their money where their mouth is and PAY UP!
