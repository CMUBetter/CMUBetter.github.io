## CMU Better

# Who we are: 

CMU Better is a group of Carnegie Mellon graduate students who build community across graduate students and advocate for better working conditions. 

We hope to include as many graduate students as we can – if you are interested, check out the [“Get Involved”](getinvolved.md) page!

# Why we're fired up:

The university continually highlights the excellent research, creative work, and teaching that graduate students do; meanwhile many graduate students sacrifice their financial stability to come here. Graduate students’ work is a big part of what makes this university great, and consequently, we should be compensated justly and given benefits to ensure that graduate students can be healthy and adequately prepared for the future financially.

**We want to raise awareness of the poor and disparate working conditions experienced by graduate students across CMU, build togetherness, and paint a more complete view of the graduate student condition here.**

When we did our first awareness campaign around pay disparities in early 2022, we received overwhelming messages of support from grad students and beyond. Many were unaware of the pay disparities between departments, and even more expressed solidarity and willingness to support grad students in worse conditions than themselves. What's more, many students shared that there were even more major problems with their grad experiences at CMU: poor mental health, a culture of overworking, and struggles with healthcare or abusive supervisors. 

Here's what we learned: Not only are there major equity and fairness issues with the CMU grad experience, but we know that despite these problems, students across the university share feelings of solidarity and are ready to help their community. 

**That's why we're here: to provide a forum for community sharing and solution building within and across our graduate student community.**
